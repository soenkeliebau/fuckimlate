# Content
The tool in this workspace is called "fuck I'm late" (fuckimlate).
Its purpose is to extract conference call dial in information from a google calendar and make it as easy as possible to dial into these meetings.
It should run on a timer (driven by systemd or some other external scheduler) and sychronize meetings and information for today to a textfile or sqlite or some other local storage.
It has to allow opening conferences with different tools, for example call the zoom executable directly, use chrome for teams, call out to slack for huddles etc.
Information in calendar entries should be extracted with the following priority: structured conference data (e.g. conferenceData.entryPoints from the API) first, then the location field, and finally pattern matching for urls on the description field as a fallback.

The interaction with the user is mainly via fuzzel, the tool should use that to display todays calendar entries in the format "[Start Time] - <Description>" and when the user selects one dial them into the meeting for that entry.

The tool also should have a "fuckimlate" command, which just auto-dials into a meeting that just started or is about to start.

# Rust Development Guidelines

## Build & Validation Commands

Always run these before considering any task complete:
```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-features
cargo build
```

For library crates, also check documentation:
```bash
cargo doc --no-deps --all-features 2>&1 | grep -E "^warning" && echo "Doc warnings found" || echo "Docs clean"
```

## Error Handling with `snafu`

All error handling **must** use [`snafu`](https://docs.rs/snafu). No `unwrap()`, `expect()`, or `Box<dyn Error>` in any code.

### Error Enum Structure

Every module with fallible operations defines its own `Error` enum in that module:
```rust
use snafu::Snafu;

#[derive(Debug, Snafu)]
#[snafu(visibility(pub))]
pub enum Error {
    #[snafu(display("Failed to read config file at {path:?}"))]
    ReadConfig {
        path: PathBuf,
        source: std::io::Error,
    },

    #[snafu(display("Invalid value {value} for field '{field}': {reason}"))]
    InvalidValue {
        value: String,
        field: &'static str,
        reason: String,
    },

    #[snafu(display("Timeout after {duration:?} waiting for {operation}"))]
    Timeout {
        duration: std::time::Duration,
        operation: String,
    },
}

pub type Result = std::result::Result;
```

### Rules

1. **Always include `source`** for errors that wrap another error. Never discard the original error.
2. **Always include context fields** that help diagnose the failure (path, key, index, etc.).
3. **Use `#[snafu(display(...))]`** on every variant — messages must be human-readable and include the relevant context fields.
4. **Use the `context()` / `whatever!()` extension methods**, never `map_err(|e| Error::Foo { source: e })` manually:
```rust
use snafu::ResultExt;

// Good
std::fs::read_to_string(&path).context(ReadConfigSnafu { path: &path })?;

// Bad
std::fs::read_to_string(&path).map_err(|e| Error::ReadConfig { path: path.clone(), source: e })?;
```

5. **Module-local error types**: Each module (or logical subsystem) has its own `Error` + `Result`. Callers wrap lower-level errors with a new variant that includes `source`:
```rust
// In parent module
#[derive(Debug, Snafu)]
pub enum Error {
    #[snafu(display("Configuration error"))]
    Config { source: crate::config::Error },
}
```

6. **No stringly-typed errors**: Avoid `snafu::Whatever` in library code. Use it only in `main()` or test helpers.
7. **`source` field must always be named `source`** so snafu can auto-propagate it in `std::error::Error::source()`.

## Interface Design

### Public API

- **Prefer returning `impl Trait` over concrete types** where the concrete type is an implementation detail.
- **Use the typestate pattern** for builders and state machines to enforce valid usage at compile time.
- **Avoid `&str` parameters that require owned data** — prefer `impl Into<String>` or `impl AsRef<str>` at the boundary.
- **Use `impl AsRef<Path>`** instead of `&Path` or `&str` for filesystem paths.
- **Prefer `&[T]` over `&Vec<T>`** and `&str` over `&String` in function signatures.
- **`Default` should be implemented** for any configuration/options struct.
- **Builder pattern for structs with 3+ optional fields**; derive or implement `Default` on the builder.

### Naming

- Types, traits: `UpperCamelCase`
- Functions, methods, variables, modules: `snake_case`
- Constants, statics: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- Error variants: descriptive nouns, not `IoError` but `ReadConfig`, `WriteOutput`, etc.
- Boolean parameters: avoid — use an enum or separate methods instead.

### Trait Implementations

Implement standard traits wherever it makes sense:
- `Debug` on everything (derive unless custom formatting is needed)
- `Clone` when copying is cheap or needed
- `Display` on user-facing types
- `From` / `TryFrom` for conversions, not bespoke `to_x()` / `from_x()` methods
- `PartialEq` / `Eq` on value types used in tests or comparisons

---

## Code Style

### Formatting

- `rustfmt` is non-negotiable. Never manually format code that `rustfmt` would change.
- Use a `rustfmt.toml` if project-specific settings are needed; document why.

### Clippy

Zero clippy warnings. Suppressions via `#[allow(...)]` must have a comment explaining why:
```rust
// `clippy::too_many_arguments` suppressed: this is a low-level syscall wrapper
// where grouping into a struct would obscure the 1:1 mapping to the API.
#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]
fn raw_call(...) {}
```

Do not suppress:
- `clippy::unwrap_used` — fix it instead
- `clippy::expect_used` in library code — fix it instead
- `clippy::panic` in library code — fix it instead

### Panics

- **Never panic in library code** unless the invariant violation is a programming error (not a user/environment error).
- Document any `panic!` or `unreachable!` with `// PANIC: <reason this is unreachable>`.
- Prefer `debug_assert!` over `assert!` for internal invariants that should be checked only in debug builds.

### Unwrap / Expect

- `unwrap()` / `expect()` are forbidden in library code.
- In test code, `unwrap()` is acceptable but `expect("context")` is preferred.
- In `main()`, use `?` propagation to a top-level `snafu::Whatever` or your binary's own `Error`.

---

## Project Structure

- Modules map to files or directories — no `mod foo { ... }` inline blocks for non-trivial code.
- `pub use` at the crate root to flatten the public API surface.
- `#[doc(hidden)]` on items that must be `pub` for macro reasons but aren't part of the API.

---

## Dependencies

- Prefer the standard library over external crates for simple tasks.
- Pin major versions in `Cargo.toml`; use `cargo update` deliberately.
- Every added dependency must justify its inclusion: size, maintenance status, license.
- Avoid multiple crates solving the same problem (e.g., two async runtimes, two HTTP clients).

---

## Documentation

- Every `pub` item must have a doc comment (`///`).
- Doc comments use full sentences ending in `.`.
- Include `# Errors` section on fallible functions listing possible error variants.
- Include `# Panics` section if the function can panic.
- `# Examples` section with a runnable `doctest` on non-trivial public functions.
```rust
/// Loads configuration from the given path.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns [`Error::ReadConfig`] if the file cannot be read.
/// Returns [`Error::ParseConfig`] if the file content is not valid TOML.
pub fn load(path: impl AsRef) -> Result { ... }
```
